# READ PLEASE!!
I did not steal any credit, this is gucktube repo just editted so it supports Discord.js V13. I repeat myself, this is not my work don't copyright me!

# How Setup
Download Recommended version of node.js, download Visual studio code as well.
Then run install.bat. Good Luck with the rest!
